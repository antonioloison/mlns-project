# mlns-project
Deep Learning based Graph embedding for nodes clustering
Project for the Machine Learning in Network Science class at CentraleSup√©lec.

## Structure of the repository
### Non-deep algorithms
Non-deep algorithms including:
- KMeans
- Spectral Clustering
- RMSC
are in the file `clustering.py`, with rather clean names.

### VAEs
VAE and IWAE are in the file `vae_clustering.py`.



### Visualization functions
In the file `visualization.py`.
